**Vue Devtools** is a development tool for VueJs. It is designed and maintained by Vue core team. You can install it as a chrome extension or firefox addon or even as an electron app.

**Vue Devtools** help us to view and debug our vue components directly in the browser.  We can see the components, their props and v-model. We can also make changes to the data property from Vue dev tools and verify the re-renders with the updated value.

The **Vue Devtools** also offers a lot more capabilities like being able to track Custom Events, inspect props (data) being passed from one component to its child, and conduct time travel debugging in a Vuex integrated app.
