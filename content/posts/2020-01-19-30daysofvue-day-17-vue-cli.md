**Vue CLI** helps us to scaffold a brand new **Webpack** bundled Vue application rapidly.

To do that we need to install `vue-cli npm `package globally. 

Once the `vue-cli `is globally installed, a new Vue project can be created by running, vue create within a specific directory and specifying the name of the project we'd want to create.

`vue create default_project`

``

The **Vue CLI** scaffolded project is hot-module reloaded which allows the application UI to update when there's a change automatically (and save) in Vue code without the need to make a hard refresh.

Vue CLI is an incredibly useful tool in helping us set up a live-reloading, module-based, single-page Vue app ready for development.
