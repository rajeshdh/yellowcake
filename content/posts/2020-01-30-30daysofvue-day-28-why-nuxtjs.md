Why use **Nuxt js?**

Nuxtjs solves the common problem that may arise when developing your Vue applications. For example:

**Combining different javascript and vue libraries optimally**. Nuxt uses webpack with vue-loader and babel-loader to bundle, code-split and minify your code.

**Code structure/organisation:**  As your application grows, it gets tough to manage your codebase without a proper organisation or code structure. Nuxt solves that by providing a standard folder structure thatâ€™s tried and tested for large scale applications.

**SEO**: nuxt takes care of SEO by using server-side rendering for our Vue applications.

**Speed**:  SSR increases the overall speed of our application because the server sends back the HTML instead of generating the HTML on the client-side.

Nuxt also provides us **production-ready configuration by default,** and if we need to change or enhance something, that is also pretty easy by just changing the nuxt.config.js
