I've completed week 1 of the [FutureLearn course 'Digital Skills: User Experience'! ](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/digital-skills-user-experience)

I am writing my answers to the questions asked in the end of week 1. 

**1. What do you think are the main advantages of having a user-centred design?**

You get to understand users need and pain points and design your app accordingly. A good design that              solves your user’s need increases user engagement and provides better customer retention. 

**2. Why is it important to do this from the start?**

It is essential to this from the start because it will help you to make a great first impression. It will also save all the extra time, work and money that you will spend redesigning the app later. 

**3. How do you know when you have achieved a really good UX?**

You have higher engagement rates and low dropouts. You are getting good customer reviews and increased market growth.
