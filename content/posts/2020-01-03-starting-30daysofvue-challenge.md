My new year resolution is to be a better version of myself. Be it in terms of health, personal life or professional life.

So as a part of the process, I am starting  #30daysofvue challenge from today. For 30 days, I'll dedicate some time daily to learn Vue js and will write down my learning on my blog. 

My goals from this challenge are to become more consistent, learn a new JS framework and get better at writing. 

I have found this e-book for 30 days of Vue to learn Vue js. I'll try to do more than one chapter a day, so I can finish this early and then will move towards coding something with Vuejs.
