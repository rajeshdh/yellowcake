Today I learned about Nuxt JS. Nuxt is a framework based on Vue.js used to create modern web applications. It uses Vue.js official libraries like vue, vue-router and vuex along with powerful development tools like webpack, Babel and PostCSS.

From the official [docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide): 

Nuxt is a framework designed to give you a robust architecture following official Vue guidelines. Incrementally adaptable, it can be used to create from static landing pages to complex enterprise-ready web applications.

Versatile by nature, it supports different targets (server, serverless or static) and server-side rendering is switchable.

Extendable with a robust module ecosystem, it makes it easy to connect your REST or GraphQL endpoints, favourites CMS, CSS frameworks and more. PWA and AMP support is only a module away from your Nuxt project.

NuxtJS is the backbone of your Vue.js project, giving structure to build your project with confidence while being flexible.



Nuxt offers the following features:

* Features
* Write Vue Files (*.vue)
* Automatic Code Splitting
* Server-Side Rendering
* Powerful Routing System with Asynchronous Data
* Static File Serving
* ES2015+ Transpilation
* Bundling and minifying of your JS & CSS
* Managing `<head> `element (`<title>, <meta>`, etc.)
* Hot module replacement in Development
* Pre-processor: Sass, Less, Stylus, etc.
* HTTP/2 push headers ready
* Extending with Modular architecture
