  Today I learned about reactivity in VueJs, and I'll explore it more tomorrow
  also.

  Today I got to know that every item in data option is reactive and any change
  on them makes Vue to re render the template. 

  For every key-value pair, we declare in the data property of an instance, and
  the Vue library creates getters and setters on that property. These setters
  and getters work under the hood to track the data properties and cause the
  template to re-render when a change has been made.
