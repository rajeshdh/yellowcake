  A personal website for me is your identity to the world. You can tell the
  world who you are? What do you do? Write a blog to share your ideas. For me,
  the goal is to make a personal brand and share ideas and experiences.I wanted
  to make a personal website for a very long time. And because I am a developer,
  I wanted to make it myself.  I even succeeded in doing so multiple times. I'll
  spend a weekend and create something a basic version of the website. But then
  I'll go back to work, and it remains there, without any content. I'll come
  back to it after months and then realise, Oh this tech is old, let me try
  something else, something new.

A personal website for me is your identity to the world. You can tell the world who you are? What do you do? Write a blog to share your ideas. 

For me, the goal is to make a personal brand and share ideas and experiences.

I wanted to make a personal website for a very long time. And because I am a developer, I wanted to make it myself.  I even succeeded in doing so multiple times. I'll spend a weekend and create something a basic version of the website. But then I'll go back to work, and it remains there, without any content. I'll come back to it after months and then realise, Oh this tech is old, let me try something else, something new. 

I'll spend most of my time building it and then having no idea of what to do with it. 

I didn't realise at that time that I need to set a primary goal, why I need a website, what will I do with it. I need to have a basic idea about the content that I am going to put on it. 

But this time, I followed a different approach. I kept the following things in mind.

* Don't spend too much time in building a website. There are already so many templates out there. You can pick one and customise it to your needs, and that's it. 
* It's the content on a website that's important, design and technologies come later.
* Set a clear goal of the number of pages and minimal functionality you want on your website.  You need to start small. It should be the bare minimum that's enough for you to start a website. For me, it was at least three pages, Home, Blog and a Contact Page.  You can add any other functionality later.
* Find the easiest way to host your website. Don't go for custom servers or anything, Use something flexible and straightforward like gatsby + netlify CMS. 

That was all for me. I took a gatsby + netlify cms template. It has one-click hosting to netlify, integrated netlify identity, netlify forms, MailChimp, upload care and SEO for me. 

I just had to do some customisations for myself. I modified the content, and that's it. I have a website up and running. 

I have some more features in mind for the website like adding social share buttons and comments to the posts, and an easy subscribe to mailing list form, adding a portfolio page, and I will add them sooner or later. 

So, I finally wrote my first blog post, on my blog and soon I will come up with some more.


If you want to get notified when I add something new to the website or write something new, you can do so by sending a message through the contact form on my Contact Page.
