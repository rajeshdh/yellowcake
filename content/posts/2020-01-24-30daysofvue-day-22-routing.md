In web development, routing often refers to splitting an application’s UI based on rules derived from the browser URL. Imagine clicking a link and having the URL go from `https://website.com` to `https://website.com /article/. `That’s routing. 

Routing is often categorized in one of two main buckets: 

**Server-side routing**: the client (i.e. the browser) makes a request to the server on every URL change.

 **Client-side routing**: the client only makes a request to the server upon initial-page load. Any changes to the application UI based on URL routes are then handled on the client. 



**Client-side routing** is where the term **single-page application (or SPA for short)** comes in. **SPAs** are web apps that load only once and are dynamically updated with user interaction without the need to make subsequent requests to the server. In modern SPAs, JavaScript is often the driving force that dynamically renders different UI.
