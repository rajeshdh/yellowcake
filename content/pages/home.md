HI, I'm Rajesh. 

I am a developer specializing in building useful things with Node.js, mongodb and react.js.

When I'm not coding, you can find me cycling or cooking something in my kitchen.

In addition to my technical work, I am also passionate about mentoring, apprenticeship, and diversity and inclusion.

You can read my writing, get in touch, or subscribe below to get updated when I write something new.
