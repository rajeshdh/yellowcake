  title: Full-Stack Web Developer
---
 I am a full-stack web developer who is passionate about designing and implementing scalable and maintainable web applications/services with the TDD/BDD approach.

I can develop complex server-side logic, definition, and maintenance of the central database, ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end.

I have always been fascinated by finding out how things work and creating something new. I thrive when I can solve complex problems with elegant solutions using web technologies and even better - learn something on the way. 

In addition to my technical work, I am also passionate about mentoring people who want to start their carrier in software development.

When I'm not coding, you can find me cycling or cooking something in my kitchen.

# My Tech Stack

Node.js, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, React.js, next.js, gatsbyJs, Mobx, Linux server,  Azure, Heroku, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, etc.

Even if your specific requirement might not be listed here, I'm a quick learner and always eager to get into new technologies & frameworks.
